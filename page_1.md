# **What is the recipe for the perfect movie in BOLLYWOOD vs. in HOLLYWOOD?**

## Abstract
The project aims at underlying the differences of a successful movie in Hollywood versus in Bollywood. In recent years, globalization induced a standardization of cultures and interests across the world. Indian and American cultures are two different cultures that emerged in an independent manner, thus comparing those 2 cultures might be a good indicator of the convergence of cultures. We propose to study this effect through various factors such as genre, runtime, lexical fields of plot, gender representation, age of the actors. We are also interested in this context of studying in how many languages are the Bollywood and Hollywood films translated as it could also be an indication of the standardization of the cultures. To evaluate this standardization we would like to study the impact of all those factors across time and how they affect the ratings of the movies.

## Research Questions
- What features stand out on the top rated films in Hollywood and Bollywood? Have these features changed/evolved over time?
- Is there a standardization of film culture over time?
- How does the runtime of the movie affect the rating? Does this effect change across time? 
- Are the ratings constant across time ?
- Are the languages of the movies evolving through time ?
